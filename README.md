# EATS Android Application

Please push your project to this repository. You will encounter conflicts once you push your project so it is your job to merge the conflicting files sensibly. For e.g each individual project has its own Android Manifest file. You must not replace the Android Manifest file but add your code to the existing Manifest file uploaded on this repository so code of other groups is not overwritten. Please note if any group fails to follow these instructions and overwrites the files shall be penalized as it is very easy to identify the culprit.
